-- How the image is handled in the Edit Blog

    The Image can be initially set be either Null or Image Path
    The Initial value is stored in the Preview State ( Preview == Null or path )
    And every Time a image is changed the File will be Updated to both Preview and File State

-- case 1 : 
    Initial preview is Null 
    User Doesn't change anything so File and Preview is Null 
    server request containing Null
-- case 2 :
    Initial preview is string
    User Doesn't change anything so File is null and Preview is string
    server request containing string
-- case 3 :
    Initial preview is string
    User change image so File is string and Preview is string
    server request containing string
-- case 4 : 
    Initial preview is null
    User change image so File is string and Preview is string
    server request containing string
